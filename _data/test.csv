The overarching goal is to have users learn more about the birds in their backyard. Lazy Birder is a unique application consisting of a connected network of hardware and software components which classifies birds, by species, that visit your home. This process is initialized when a bird comes to your bird feeder, specifically one that is suction-cupped to a window in your home. While gathering seed, a Raspberry Pi computer detects motion and takes a picture of the bird. This image is then sent to a Google Cloud instance where it is classified using a Keras-based machine-learning model. Upon classification, this image and associated metadata is sent to a locally-hosted Django website. Here, a post is created for the appropriate user which consists of the image, date, and species name. Users can view the birds that have recently visited their feeder, as well as learn what kind of seed each species likes the most. The result is a robust application which consists of multiple efficient and effective parts which can classify twenty bird species with an eighty-percent accuracy.","Computer Vision, Web Development, Computer Networking, Raspberry Pi, Python",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MpHF3LUluQ
4/16/2021 13:23:18,wallacek2@wit.edu,Computer Science,Pryvate,"Mathieu Berthier, Gia Hill, Katrina Wallace","Wachusett Ski Resort (WSR) has been using an analog system to keep track of private lessons for several years. Pryvate intends to convert the analog system into a few web pages intended for employee use within WSR’s internal website. With WSR’s current private lesson tracking system, an employee must collect individual student information, date and time of lesson, type of lesson, and length of lesson in order to adequately record a lesson. Pryvate takes into account the various constraints before allowing a user to create a lesson. After adding a lesson instance with Pryvate, users are able to view all lessons added by date and filter the results shown based on various characteristics such as paid, checked in, and finalized. Along with adding and viewing lessons, users are also able to modify lesson and student information. . Pryvate is made to help modernize and simplify the current system WSR is using. By digital record keeping, Pryvate will contribute in minimizing human error and improving employee efficiency.","Analog system, full-stack programming, corporate software",https://youtu.be/39q-GuzOCBE
4/17/2021 17:24:27,shresthas6@wit.edu,Computer Science,WITShare,"Sahaj Shrestha, Jungeon Lee, Christopher Villamarin","WITShare is a classified e-commerce website exclusively to be used just inside the Wentworth community for the sake of convenience and reliability amongst ourselves. The variety in different brands and features of the school materials and resources used for a particular class (say a Graphing Calculator required for a Calculus II class) can cause confusion amongst the student to decide to choose a reliable, economic and the precise material being demanded for the course. WITShare solves this issue by confining the transaction between the Wentworth community. After the user signs himself in, WITShare allows the user to post new items, purchase the item posted, search for a specific item with it’s name, or delete the item that he himself had posted. The student posting the items would need to identify themselves in the post with their name and contact information. The student who is willing to buy the item has to contact the seller and meet him in school, so the payment does not necessarily have to be processed through the Paypal if the buyer decides to pay cash to the seller. As the buyer and seller have to meet each other to complete the trade, the buyer can get tutorials regarding the material from the seller and this also offers opportunity for the students to socialize and make new friends.

Because of this, watching dietary intake is especially crucial for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Table Tallies is a web application developed by three undergraduate Computer Science students with the purpose of providing users a quick yet effective way to acquire recipes for hundreds of different meals. Through many unique filters for different diet types, allergies, and calorie count, users are given the opportunity to efficiently discover new recipes to fit their dietary needs. Instead of making the user jump through making an account, signing up for a newsletter, or paying a subscription fee to access restricted content, Table Tallies provides an easy interface to its users with free links to filtered meals. Users can select a filter such as vegan, kosher, peanut-free, dairy-free and many others, making choosing a meal that fits their diet a clear and effortless activity. Table Tallies was created with the intention of being accessible to all users on several different platforms and browsers. No one should be cut off from accessing a plethora of healthy recipes to fit whatever dietary needs they may have. Through its efficiency and accessibility, Tables Tallies can have a positive impact in inspiring users to eat healthier.
