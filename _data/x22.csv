As more facets of society become increasingly dependent on the Internet and technology in general, people of all levels of technical aptitude must adjust to the modern world of accessing and distributing information or services online. Spartan Security aims to provide users with a password management platform to support their increasing digital presence. In addition to the development of a web application for password management and a chromium-based browser extension for password autofill authentication across the Internet, machine learning algorithms were utilized by the team to enhance user experience and overall online privacy. The machine learning models developed by the team include a website vulnerability model to detect any potential security concerns while validating user credentials in the browser autofill extension, and a password strength model to provide feedback to users when adding new site credentials to their Spartan Security account. These models expand the standard offerings of a password management service by providing both traditional digital organization of passwords as well as personalized security notices and suggestions. This project bridges the gap between password management and vulnerability detection into a single service. As Spartan Security reaches more users, the team will continue to adapt the security models to stay ahead of the curve as a password management security platform.

People often turn to their friends for recommendations and make the song searching process into a social activity. SEND/RETURN aims to solve your song searching concerns while packaging the song searching process into a new virtual medium. We wrangled together a dataset of Spotify's audio features and previews, via their API, using a custom Python script. This data then trained a k-means clustering and stumpy Fast Pattern Matching (FPM) algorithm to find the most similar songs within our dataset to recommend to our users, based on any Spotify song of their choice. The algorithms use Spotify's audio features, such as ""danceability"", ""energy"", and ""valence"", in combination with spectral features, using librosa. The feature values of the song returned from our algorithm are communicated via HTTP to an Unreal Engine 5 virtual environment, which reacts in real-time. All of this is being replicated from a listen-server to other clients to create a multiplayer audio session. Self-hosted flask servers allow for LAN play, while internet sessions require our global Flask server.

This research investigates the practicality of utilizing historical satellite imagery data in order to calculate the water levels of key watershed locations in areas that experience heavy droughts and extreme dryness. The satellite data was accessible via the Sentinel-2 Satellite open API and gave access to imagery dating back to 2017. Each image pulled covered an area of 100 km x 100 km . Initial water detection in images was tested with given K-Means and agglomerative clustering (AGC), where AGC gave more consistent results for images of different locations. The classification of clusters was carried out via support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The final step of processing was then utilizing connected component analysis in order to remove noise from the images, then surface area of the detected water was calculated with the known size of the images. Effectiveness of the algorithms was tested by comparing the calculated surface areas to the available data of known water levels for the watersheds. The results varied between ~70% to ~85% accuracy , and indicate that with more access to consistent historical data to train on , the provided machine learning algorithms in conjunction with image processing techniques can provide accurate water level calculations.

Users are able to submit posts to specific pods and comment on those posts. There is a navigation bar at the top of the interface that routes users to other pods and the main content feed.  The content display emulates modern dating apps, where users are able to swipe and tap through cards that display image and text posts. The content feed consists of up to the 6 most recent posts in a pod, previewing the content within a certain pod to a user. A right swipe indicates the user’s interest in the piece of content, a left swipe indicates that the user is not interested in the piece of content. Upon a right swipe, a user is prompted with the choice to be routed to the pod where the content was posted into or the user can resume swiping through the content feed.","Modern Content feed, Pods, Swiping",Othman_2,Othman_2_Poster.pdf,https://youtu.be/l5_HRjhQkQE,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zrd2nSJfoIQkCkHWy_OiNIxJHxDGuJ-K

Hyperparameter tuning is also performed on the ANN to try and find an optimal solution.","AI, handwritten digit recognition. backpropagation",Qranfal_9,Qranfal_9_Poster.pdf,https://youtu.be/cqm7AmuM0Kk,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1afhRSb8Tq0lzFfzVqdJNxYtBoPd8Q9Ms

Prouty,"This semester we investigated the many properties of Markov chains, with a goal of being able to apply it to understanding the statistics of baseball and make our own predictions using the data and results we gathered. We researched the transformation of Markov chains into stochastic matrices and worked with theorems such as Wielandt’s theorem and the Perron-Frobenius theorem. Using two methods, a regular method and decomposition, we were able to solve for the steady state of these stochastic matrices. After gathering a months’ worth of data on Red Sox games, we used both methods to calculate a steady state for the plays that will occur in any given Red Sox game, as well as the average number of runs the team will score per game, with an accuracy of nearly 6%.","Markov chains, baseball, statistics, analytics, linear algebra",Qranfal_10,Qranfal_10_Poster.pdf,https://youtu.be/aXN_Jl5IuxY,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1W-EJtmTJnKOOgafS2i5m-31Q_FijtNYk

The game keeps over 140 million active users, with over 2 million playing at any given time. Millions of players play the modded version of the games, many through modpacks (a precompiled collection of mods) that are currently starting to be updated to newer versions of the base game. Resulting in mods also having to be updated. Currently, mods that fulfill a similar purpose as Nivadeus will have ceased development as their creators have moved, with the one notable exception being similar in being a magic mod, but not otherwise. This loss of many magic mods that populate current modpacks has created a void that Nivadeus will fill as those modpacks update to newer game versions. Nivadeus provides users with extensive flexibility through the use of dynamically crafted spells with which they can interact with the game world. Nivadeus uses this flexibility to allow players to use spells as a utility toolkit to enhance their gameplay regardless of how that may be structured or altered from other game mods.","The entertainment industry, Minecraft, Modded",Yun_4,Yun_4_Poster.pdf,https://youtu.be/fzGO1JX0P8s,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1C-eM-mNBoG1GZaek0pAxsr9JRcaf_iXR

Many popular brands like Nike, Jordan, Yeezy, and others produce favored sneakers that are high in demand, but low in supply. As a result, many different 3rd-party websites have been created where users can buy and sell sneakers that have already sold out. Due to the nature of these markets, prices are usually higher than the retail value, and can fluctuate constantly. When you combine this with the fact that there are many different resale websites, all with different prices, finding a fair deal can be tedious. We propose a solution to these problems and describe the design of our website, Sneaker Saver. Sneaker Saver is a tool that allows users to search for a specific sneaker. Sneaker Saver provides the information including the release date, retail price, average market price, and links to the 3rd-party sites. The goal is to save users time and money by making the search for a fair deal quick and easy through the utilization of Sneaker Saver.

Usually, network security is focused around enterprise users, leaving the home network relatively undefended. Project Goose seeks to bridge this capability gap by bringing enterprise level software to the home in an affordable package. Zabbix and Suricata are open-source tools. Zabbix provides network management and device detection, while Suricata provides intrusion detection and traffic scanning. When put together, the result is a suite of software running on a Raspberry Pi capable of detecting new connections to the network, monitoring ongoing network traffic, and logging potential malicious activity. Users are then alerted through the use of a Discord server, with a webhook sending Zabbix notifications, and a custom bot sending the Suricata log once per hour, each action causing an alert on a users phone and desktop.

We propose Atlas as a social media adjacent site to create a place for web developers to share their projects with others to get feedback on how accessible their websites are for people with disabilities. While there are tools for testing website accessibility, they are often expensive to use and only larger companies will be able to afford them. With an open-source accessibility testing community, the web developers’ work will greatly benefit from Atlas.

Current templates include a school system where hundreds of students will connect to a network, with strict security requirements regarding student data. The other template is a hybrid workforce finance company, where its users will connect to the network from different locations, and customer data security is key. These templates provide the different business types with all the systems, networking and security services needed to run their business.

However, the existing application for booking these rooms lacks both an interface and any room information. Instead students have to look at a list of room names and input 30-minute time slots into an Outlook appointment until they see a room is free. By using Wentworth’s LibCal website, we revamped this system to provide a large interface availability grid and provided more necessary and customized information on each room. Our new booking system includes pictures of the space, details on location, capacity, and amenities, and updated notifications on which rooms have display screens or power outlets that are out-of-order. We improved the Douglas Library's booking system by providing an innovative and extremely student friendly interface.

Modern chat programs – namely Slack – provide an easy to use, cohesive package that easily meets the needs of different companies. However, these services rely on central data storage for message history, meaning potentially sensitive information is being stored remotely on another company’s servers. This is at best a security concern, and at worst a dealbreaker for using the software, when non-disclosure agreements are strict. In this project, we propose a new chat program, Beacon, to remedy this issue by allowing organizations to self-host their own servers, keeping all valuable chat data within the organization’s hands. To attract users who may not be as concerned with self-hosting, Beacon also offers traditional, centrally hosted servers for quick and easy communication.","Chat Program, Online Communication, Web App, Server Hosting",Yun_12,Yun_12_Poster.pdf,https://youtu.be/U-VpfbvAMqg,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OrwPqNL-9UDvKv_FTaScfy_gEYe976jK
